Subject: Formal Resignation – Aayush Ranjan

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to formally submit my resignation from my role at EXL Service, with my last working day being Friday, 12th July 2025.

I have recently received an admission offer from IIT Hyderabad for the M.Tech program in Computer Science and Engineering, which I have decided to pursue as it aligns strongly with my long-term goals in data science and technology.

I am currently in the final phase of the insurance reserves prediction model project, working closely with Arun and Anurang. I will ensure that all my responsibilities are completed by the end of next week and that a proper handover is done before my departure.

I sincerely appreciate the support, mentorship, and opportunities provided to me during my time here. The experience at EXL has been instrumental in shaping my technical and professional skills.

Kindly consider this as my official resignation and let me know the steps to initiate the exit process. I am happy to assist in any way needed during this transition.

Thank you once again.

Best regards,
Aayush Ranjan
